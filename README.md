High-Performance Grass Renderer in C++ and OpenGL
This project is a real-time grass renderer built from the ground up in C++ using modern OpenGL. It demonstrates how to render vast, animated fields of grass efficiently by leveraging GPU instancing and procedural animation within shaders. The final scene includes a dynamic field of 10,000+ grass blades, a ground plane, a skybox, and a full lighting model.

Features
GPU Instancing: Renders tens of thousands of grass blades with a single draw call for maximum performance.
Procedural Animation: Grass blades sway realistically in the wind using a sine wave animation calculated in the vertex shader.
Dynamic Variety: Each blade of grass has a random height and rotation to create a natural, non-uniform appearance.
Blinn-Phong Lighting: The scene is lit with a directional light source, featuring ambient, diffuse, and specular components for added realism.
Skybox Environment: A cubemapped skybox provides a complete and immersive background for the scene.
First-Person Camera: A fully interactive first-person camera with keyboard (WASD) and mouse controls allows for free exploration of the scene.
Core Concepts
The primary goal of this project was to render a large number of similar objects without sacrificing performance. This was achieved through two main principles:
Offloading Work to the GPU: Instead of looping on the CPU to draw each blade, we upload the geometry for a single blade and a large array of transformation matrices to the GPU. A single glDrawElementsInstanced call then tells the GPU to do all the work in parallel.
Shader-Based Detail: All the complex visual details—such as the pointy shape of the blades, the color gradients, the lighting, and the wind animation—are handled entirely within the vertex and fragment shaders. This keeps the base geometry extremely simple and efficient.
Dependencies
To build and run this project, you will need the following libraries:
GLFW: For creating the window, context, and handling user input.
GLAD: To load modern OpenGL function pointers.
GLM (OpenGL Mathematics): For all vector and matrix operations.
stb_image: For loading the skybox textures.
How to Build
Set up your dependencies: Ensure that your build environment (e.g., Visual Studio) can find the header files and library files for GLFW, GLAD, and GLM.
Configure Include Directories: In your project settings, add the paths to the include folders for all required libraries.
Configure Linker: Add the necessary library files (e.g., glfw3.lib, opengl32.lib) to your project's linker settings.
Compile: Build the main.cpp file.
Run: Place the skybox folder (containing the six skybox images) and all shader files (.vert, .frag) in the same directory as the final compiled executable.
